<br>
          <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my corner of the web! I’m Brendan Castaneda,
            an aspiring software developer with a passion for combining
            creativity and technology to build innovative solutions. Currently
            pursuing my Associate degree in Software Development at Mid-State
            College, I’m laying the foundation for a career that bridges
            problem-solving and cutting-edge technology.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As a first-generation American of Latin descent, I bring a rich
            multicultural perspective to everything I do. Fluent in three
            languages, I thrive in diverse environments where communication and
            collaboration are key. My heritage and experiences shape my approach
            to challenges, enabling me to think critically, adapt quickly, and
            connect authentically with people from all walks of life.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            After earning my degree, I plan to advance my studies at the
            University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, where I’ll focus on
            Information Technology. My ultimate goal is to craft impactful
            solutions that enhance lives, whether through developing efficient
            software systems or creating seamless user experiences.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I’m a hands-on creator who thrives on turning ideas
            into reality. From tinkering with 3D printers to capturing the world
            through photography, I find joy in blending technical skills with
            artistic expression. My hobbies—woodworking, mixed media, and
            digital media creation—reflect my love for exploration and my
            commitment to mastering new crafts.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of continuous learning and innovation to
            drive change. If you share my enthusiasm for creativity, technology,
            and making things happen, let’s connect!
